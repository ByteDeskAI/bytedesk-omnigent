"""Bridge utilities for the native Claude Code wrapper.

The native wrapper has two live processes that need to rendezvous:

- Claude Code, running in the user's terminal resource.
- The Omnigent harness turn, running when the web UI submits a
  message to the session agent.

This module owns the small filesystem rendezvous directory plus two
helper surfaces:

- An MCP stdio server (``serve-mcp`` subcommand) that Claude Code
  launches as a child process. It advertises Omnigent tools to
  Claude (workspace ``sys_os_*`` tools outside an active turn,
  active-turn Omnigent tools via a per-turn relay).
- A tmux send-keys path. Web UI messages are delivered to Claude by
  typing them into the same tmux pane the user is attached to;
  Claude treats them as ordinary user input. The runner advertises
  the pane's socket + target in ``tmux.json`` after launching the
  ``claude/main`` terminal.

Claude's experimental Channels MCP capability was the original input
path but is blocked at the org policy layer, so this bridge does not
use it.
